# Trustworthy AI: algorithm assessment

Within the EDGE-Skills project, Trustworthy AI Building Block (BB04) has the particularity of being designed as a toolkit of several services.
BB04 is mainly composed of three tools whose design documents are detailed in the following respective links:

- [LORIA's LOLA platform](lola/design-document-LORIA.md)
- [AffectLog's AffectLog360 platform](affectlog/design-document-AffectLog.markdown)
- [University of Koblenz's CARiSMA platform](carisma/README.md)
  
These tools are implemented as autonomous and complementary assessment platforms in order to improve the understandability of the AI scenario and, thereby, contribute to fulfill documentation obligations as defined in [EUâ€™s AI Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence).

Each is intended for different use cases relating to the life cycle of software solutions integrating AI technologies

They have in common a contribution to trustworthy AI by proposing measures of properties such as security, explainability, transparency and reproducibility.
