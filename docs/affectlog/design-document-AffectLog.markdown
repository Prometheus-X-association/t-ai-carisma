## Dynamic Behaviour
Sequence diagram for generating model explanations:

1. **User Submission**: The User submits a model and data to the ModelAdapter.
2. **Retrieval of Information**:
   - The ModelAdapter retrieves DataCard information from the DataCard service.
   - The ModelAdapter retrieves ModelCard information from the ModelCard service.
3. **Adaptation**: The ModelAdapter adapts the model for the ExplanationGenerator.
4. **Data and Model Security**: The ExplanationGenerator secures the data via the SecurityLayer.
5. **Explanation Generation**:
   - The ExplanationGenerator generates explanations, feature importance, and compares models.
6. **Result Processing**: The ExplanationGenerator sends the results to the ResultsProcessor, which formats the results.
7. **User Feedback**: The formatted results are returned to the User.

## Configuration and Deployment Settings
Configuration options include model type, explanation type (global or local), and computational resources allocation. Logging operations include tracking of explanation generation processes, error handling, and performance metrics. Error scenarios might involve unsupported model types or data formats, and insufficient computational resources for large datasets.

Usage limits are defined based on the computational complexity of the models being explained and the size of the dataset. For instance, a limit on the number of features or records that can be processed in a single explanation request may be set to ensure optimal performance.
