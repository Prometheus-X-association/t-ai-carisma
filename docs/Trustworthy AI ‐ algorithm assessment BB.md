# Trustworthy AI: algorithm assessment BB

In the dynamic world of AI, LORIA and Affectlog's Trustworthy AI Assessment initiative is central to fostering trust and transparency. This program integrates two sophisticated and complementary platforms â€” LORIA's audit platform for data and algorithms and Affectlog's safety assessment platform. 

These platforms improve the transparency and safety of AI technologies, which are critical for stakeholders in the education, healthcare and technology sectors.
By providing detailed insights and safety assessments, they set a new standard for trust and ethical AI use.

These two platforms are described respectively :
